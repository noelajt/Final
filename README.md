# CPSC458 FINAL PROJECT

This is my final project for Web Development. I created a web app to help new graduates find those moving to the same city to be roommates with.

NOTE: There are features / code for components that are for future iterations. I could not get them to function properly but would love to work on them in the feature. This includes the autocomplete function and the dropdown filters.
